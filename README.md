This is a simple Python tool to generate SAIN-LIM plots.

SAIN-LIM is a nutritional index used to graphically assess foods. It considers nutrients to promote (SAIN), which are protein, fiber, vitamin C, calcium and iron, and nutrients to limit (LIM), which are saturated fat, sugar and sodium. When calculated, the values place each food into one of four quadrants: Recommended, To be consumed ocasionally, Neutral and To limit.

This program reads the SAIN and LIM values from a DataFrame and generates a plot with all its points. The data is read using Pandas, and the plot is created using Matplotlib.

SAIN_LIM_plots.py contains the Python code to generate the plot.

sainlimdata.xlsx is an example data file in Excel.
